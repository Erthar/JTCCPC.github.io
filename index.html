		<h2>About Us</h2>
		<p>&emsp;In the Programming Club, our goal is to have like-minded individuals working together in improving their skills and forge long-lasting connections. We will work in many programming languages on many projects. You’ll be able to collaborate with developers of similar interest and work on fun projects! If you are a newbie to programming, do not worry; you’ll have access to a room full of knowledge. 
		</p>
		<p>&emsp;We have physical meetings on-campus along with online meetings via Discord. So, if you can't make physical meetings, you can still collaborate through the power of the Internet!</p>
		<p>&emsp;If you're a JTCC student and want to particpate, <a href="contact.html" style="">Contact Us!</a></p>
		<p>&emsp;This website is an ongoing project for John Tyler Community College's Programming Club.</p>
